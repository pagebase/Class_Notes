# Data security issues

Data security issues arise when sensitive information is exposed, misused, or compromised due to weak protection measures. Here are the **major data security issues**:

---

### 1. **Data Breaches**

- Unauthorized access to confidential data.
    
- Can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, or leakage of trade secrets.
    

---

### 2. **Unauthorized Access**

- Weak passwords, poor authentication, or stolen credentials allow intruders into systems.
    
- Insider threats also fall under this category.
    

---

### 3. **Data Leakage**

- Accidental or intentional sharing of sensitive data.
    
- Examples: misconfigured cloud storage, sending files to the wrong recipient.
    

---

### 4. **Malware & Ransomware Attacks**

- Malicious software can corrupt, steal, or encrypt data.
    
- Ransomware locks data until a ransom is paid.
    

---

### 5. **Phishing & Social Engineering**

- Attackers trick users into revealing login details or personal information.
    
- Often through fake emails, websites, or phone calls.
    

---

### 6. **Insecure Networks**
